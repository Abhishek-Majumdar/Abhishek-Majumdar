## Hi, welcome to my GIT repository

**I currently work as a senior programmer analyst.**

On this repository you will find experimentational projects around, 
- Asynchronous programming 
- Data science
- Computer vision
- Machine Learning

I am currently exploring **blockchain technology & algorithmic trading**; and would add these projects shortly. 

> Don’t worry if it doesn’t work right.If everything did, you’d be out of a job.


*I am yet to check in a lot of my work, so some of the mentioned projects might be missing from the repository as of now.*
